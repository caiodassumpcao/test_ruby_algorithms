Ruby Algorithms Test Repository Description

This repository contains a collection of Ruby projects focused on algorithmic problem-solving. Each project represents a different algorithm or data structure implemented in Ruby. The projects are organized into the lib/ directory, while the corresponding tests can be found in the spec/ directory. Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows: test_ruby_algorithms/ ├── lib/ │ ├── binary_search.rb │ ├── bubble_sort.rb │ ├── linked_list.rb │ ├── merge_sort.rb │ └── ... ├── spec/ │ ├── binary_search_spec.rb │ ├── bubble_sort_spec.rb │ ├── linked_list_spec.rb │ ├── merge_sort_spec.rb │ └── ... ├── README.md └── ...

The lib/ directory contains the implementation code for each project, while the spec/ directory holds the corresponding test files. Available Projects

Here is a list of the projects currently available in this repository:

Project 1: Implementation of a binary search algorithm.
Project 2: Implementation of a bubble sort algorithm.
Project 3: Implementation of a linked list data structure.
Project 4: Implementation of a merge sort algorithm.
...
Each project has its own directory under lib/, and the tests for each project are located in the spec/ directory, following a naming convention of projectX_spec.rb, where X represents the project number. Usage

To use these projects, you can clone the repository locally: git clone https://github.com/caiodassumpcao/test_ruby_algorithms.git

After cloning, you can explore each project's implementation in the lib/ directory and run the corresponding tests located in the spec/ directory to verify their correctness. Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you have ideas for new algorithmic projects or improvements to existing ones, feel free to open a pull request. Please refer to CONTRIBUTING.md for more details on how to contribute. License
